Project report: [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nzvjpgmcwvqf)

This repository contains files relevant to our study and development of the best approach to classify FMRI scans.
## Files:
* **main_file_cnn.ipynb, main_file_cnn_delivery_2.ipynb, main_file_cnn_delivery_3.ipynb** contain codes for our first CNN models, code for model training and evaluation,
* **heatmap.ipynb** can be used to lake a look into images and pixel-wise variance,
* **deliverable_1.pdf, deliverable_2.pdf, deliverable_3.pdf** contains an elaborate project description, model structures, performance results, completed and future tasks.
* **Image_thresholding.ipynb** contains thresholding transform script
* **augmetation_fmri.ipynb** contains albumentation and SMOTe implementation (upsampling)
